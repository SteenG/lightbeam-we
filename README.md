# lightbeam-we
Web Extension version of the Mozilla Lightbeam add-on

## Notes

Lightbeam is no longer maintained by [Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/lightbeam-extension-firefox-no-longer-supported).
I have been involved with Lightbeam since 2017 through Outreachy and [PrototypeFund.de](https://prototypefund.de/project/lightbeam/) programs. I now take responsibility to maintain this web extension!

Lightbeam is being extensively used by researchers and currently I am helping the [Global Data Justice Project](https://globaldatajustice.org/) with their research. More details [here](https://github.com/princiya/lightbeam-import).
